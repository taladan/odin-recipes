        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
          <li><sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> cup white sugar</li>
          <li>1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tablespoons active dry yeast</li>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Dissolve sugar in warm water in a large bowl, then stir in yeast.  Allow to proof until yeast resembles a creamy foam, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
          <li>Mix oil and salt into the yeast.  Mix in flour one cup at a time. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth.  Place in a well-oiled bowl, and turn dough to coat.  Cover with a damp loth.  Allow to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.</li>
          <li>Punch dough down.  Knead for a few minutes, and divide in half.  SHape into loaves, and place into two well-oiled 9x5-inch loaf pans.  Allow to rise until dough has topped the pans by one inch, about 30 minutes.</li>
          <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oveh to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
          <li>Bake the risen loaves in the preheated oven until golden brown for 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
